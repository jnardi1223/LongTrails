* Reviews/Ratings

    On a trails index page. Users can see all the reviews and a 1-5 rating for each. When a user is signed in they have the option to leave their own review on the page. I was able to do this by down the current user using React/Redux state managment. By using this same logic, I was able to only users to edit or delete their comments only if they were the author.
